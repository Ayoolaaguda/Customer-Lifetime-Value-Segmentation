# Customer-Lifetime-Value-Segmentation
In this project, i conducted an in-depth analysis of customer lifetime value segmentation at NexaSat.
Using Advanced Sql techniques, i uncovered insights that identified upselling and cross-selling opportunities in the telecom industry. 
This hands-on experience allowed me to leverage data-driven strategies to maximize revenue potential and enhance customer engagement. 
I used Power BI to visualize and present my findings, making my analysis more accessible and understandable for stakeholders.
